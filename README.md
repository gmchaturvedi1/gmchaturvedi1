**gmchaturvedi1/gmchaturvedi1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a software engineer based in Ghaziabad, India with over 6 years of experience. I've worked all ends of the stack, from back to front to back again!

Nowadays I primarily focus on the front-end and Full Stack, with a heavy focus on Nodejs, Graphql ,React and React Native. I also like to learning and play around with  Python and Django (as I am a perfectionist with deadlines), as well as Rust.
